# flogue
A rogue-like used to teach my son.

# To run
* Be sure that http-server is installed
* in flogue/monet run "nodemon app.js"
* in flogue run "http-server ./"
* In browser visit http://localhost:8080/src/index.html

# Hints
To void over-use of the mouse:
When in the File Open dialog in Sublime
* Cmd+UpArrow goes up a directory, them Cmd+Shift+G and type in the relative path. Sadly .. is not accepted.
* To see hidden files in finder type Cmd+Shift+i   (i for invisible)
* Cmd+Tab moves among apps, Ctrl+Tab among Sublime tabs, and Cmd+W closes Sublime tabs

In Chrome
* fn+downArrow goes down a page
* Cmd+Tab and Cmd+Shift+Tab go among tabs, and Cmd+W closes tabs.
* Cmd+~ moves amonth MacOs's windows for a specific app. You'll need this for Terminal
